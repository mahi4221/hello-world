            <h1> I LOVE GAMES</h1>
            <P> Games are activities designed for entertainment, competition, or skill development.
                They can be physical, like sports, or digital, like video games.
                Board games such as chess and ludo have been played for centuries.
                Video games became popular in the late 20th century with arcade machines.
                Today, video games can be played on PCs, consoles, and mobile devices.
                Many games involve rules that define how players can interact.
                Single-player games are designed for one person’s experience.
                Games can help improve hand-eye coordination.
                They can also enhance memory and focus.
                Many people use games as a way to relax and relieve stress.
                that connects people, challenges minds, and fuels imagination.

                Kabaddi is a traditional team sport that originated in ancient India and is now played worldwide. 
                It involves two teams, where a “raider” runs into the opponent's half, tags as many players as possible, 
                and returns to their side without being caught, all while holding their breath and chanting “kabaddi.” 
                The game requires strength, agility, strategy, and teamwork. Today, kabaddi is played professionally in leagues
                like the Pro Kabaddi League (PKL) and is recognized as a popular competitive sport across Asia and beyond.

                The Diamond Game, also called Chinese Checkers, is a classic board game played on a star-shaped board. 
                Players aim to move all their pieces across the board into the opposite triangle by steps or jumps. 
                It is a simple yet strategic game that can be played by 2-6 players.
